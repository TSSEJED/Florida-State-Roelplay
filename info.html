                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>At Florida State Roleplay, our staff is committed to fairness, treating everyone equally without bias. Every staff member faces the same consequences for rule violations. Our team exemplifies our core values: integrity, respect, determination, honesty, and excellence. Any failure to uphold these principles results in accountability. Staff members abide by the same rules as regular members and receive equivalent consequences for infractions. Effective collaboration ensures smooth operations, addressing issues professionally and discreetly, avoiding public disputes.</p>

                        <h3>1.0 General</h3>
                        <p>As many of you know there is a quota, the quota is 2 hours. However we encourage you to aim to surpass this goal by staying consistently active during the week, to avoid trying to reach quota last minute.</p>
                        <p>Never argue with HR. Follow their instructions when given. If you believe a decision was unjust, open a management ticket.</p>
                        <p>Follow the chain of command at all times.</p>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h3>1.1 In-Game Policies</h3>
                        <p>While you are on duty you are required to follow our avatar policy. This includes blocky-avatars and avoiding unrealistic effects, accessories, or excessive add-ons.</p>
                        <p>There must be at least 10 players in-game before you are able to be on duty, in uniform, and in a staff car. However you are allowed to issue punishments if there are less than 10 people in game.</p>
                        <p>When you go on break you are required to despawn your staff car and change out of uniform.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 Professionalism</h3>
                        <p>Whether you are on-duty, managing a ticket, or making an announcement you must use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar.</p>
                        <p>When addressing mod calls, consider both perspectives thoroughly. Witness statements alone are insufficient; valid evidence must be presented.</p>
                        <p>Favoritism towards any individual is strongly prohibited and will result in a strike or worse.</p>

                    <h3>Additional Guidelines</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Within announcement and session channels try to avoid pinging @everyone to avoid frustrating members</li>
                        <li>Avoid causing drama in the in-game server, any channels, and any voice-channels.</li>
                        <li>Always respect people with every interaction, as you will leave a good impression on the player.</li>
                        <li>Please use channels for what they are properly supposed to be used for.</li>
